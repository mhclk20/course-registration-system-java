## 📖 Overview
This project simulates a real-world university course registration scenario. It allows students to select courses while the system backend performs logic checks to prevent schedule conflicts.

## ⚙️ Key Features
* **Conflict Detection Algorithm:** Automatically warns the user if a selected course clashes with an existing schedule.
* **OOP Implementation:** Built using robust Object-Oriented Programming principles (Classes, Objects, Methods).
* **Capacity Logic:** Simulates real-world constraints like course quotas.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Java** (Core Logic)
* **IntelliJ IDEA** (Development Environment)
